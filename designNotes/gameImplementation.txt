Client Side - Joining a game


Player clicks join. They are taken to the game lobby. 

  If they are the only player in game lobby their client creates a new game object (with game id). 

  If there is already another player(s) in the game lobby the following happens via sockets:
	-They should receive the game object from player 1.
	-Their player id should be added to the game object for all players in the lobby.
	-After their id has been added to game object, check to see if game is full. If so close game, and redirect all players in game to game page using the game id.
